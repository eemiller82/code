        <p class="lead">Along with tracking changes in an edit review, you should also use the comment tool in Word to address specific problems in an edit and provide guidance to researchers on how to solve problems in their writing. Be careful not to overuse comments in the edit. You should not comment on every change that you make—only comment on the changes that the researchers may not understand or that require the researchers’ input or verification. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Once you’ve accepted the changes in the document, update this field so that it reflects those changes.</li>
            <li>Headings should be used only to introduce a new section of text. Place paragraph text under this heading before introducing the next level of heading.</li>
            <li>When outlining your paper, there should be at least two heading levels per section, or do not use the heading level.</li>
            <li>You do not refer to this figure in your text. Insert a reference to this figure in the paragraph before the figure appears.</li>
        </ul></div>

    <h3 class="container">Grammar and Mechanics</h1>
        <div class="container-lg">
            <ul>
                <li>You alternate in the paper between writing this term out and using the acronym. Acronyms are best used for terms that are cumbersome or that get used frequently in the paper. Because this term does not fall into either of those categories, I suggest that you write it out instead of use the acronym. Whatever you decide to do, be consistent throughout the paper.</li>
                <li>When the full version of a term appears for the first time in a heading, do not define the abbreviation in the heading; instead define the abbreviation when the full version next appears.</li>
                <li>In general, if you abbreviate a term, use the abbreviation at least three times in a paper. If you use the abbreviation only one or two times, readers may have difficulty remembering what it means, so writing the term out each time aids comprehension.</li>
                <li>Is it necessary to capitalize this term? Only capitalize this if it is a proper noun, not a common noun (e.g., the official title of a department or organization versus a general term). Consider lowercasing it throughout the paper.</li>
                <li>You are the sole author on the report, so “we” does not make sense here. Use first person singular (I, my) instead, or clarify whom you mean by “we.”</li>
                <li>Use “they” as a generic third-person singular pronoun to refer to a person whose gender is unknown or irrelevant to the context of the usage. Although usage of the singular “they” was once discouraged in academic writing, it is now accepted and endorsed.</li>
                <li>Do not use first person (my/our/we) in a general sense to refer to Americans, the United States, a branch of the military, military personnel, etc. Use first person only to refer to you as authors specifically.</li>
                <li>Per APA style, do not use a colon after an introduction that is not an independent clause or complete sentence. </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>This source isn’t in your reference list. I’ve started a placeholder for you there. Either clarify which existing source this is or complete the entry I started for this source. Once you’ve completed the reference list entry, update this citation with the correct author and publication date if needed.</li>
                    <li>I created this reference entry based on one of your in-text citations. Please add a first initial for the author, the source title, and publication information.</li>
                    <li>I have not edited the entries in this reference list. The use of Word’s Reference tools does not allow me to comment within the field. I have copied and pasted the entries into a separate document and edited them there. Once you review that document and accept the changes to it, insert the new entries here, but do not insert them back into a field—delete this field completely.</li>
                    <li>This URL is no longer working. Update the link so that this source is retrievable.</li>
